=== Artificial Intelligence ===
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
These include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing.
AI has become a key technology in various industries such as healthcare, education, finance, and transportation.
Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows systems to learn from experience and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed.
Deep learning, on the other hand, uses neural networks to simulate human-like thinking processes.

=== Computer Networks ===
Computer networks allow devices to communicate and share data across the world.
A network can be classified as a LAN (Local Area Network), MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), or WAN (Wide Area Network) depending on its geographical coverage.
The Internet is the largest network, connecting billions of devices globally.
Networking relies on communication protocols such as TCP/IP that define how data is transmitted and received.
Routers, switches, and servers are essential components that ensure efficient data routing and connectivity.

=== Databases ===
A database is an organized collection of structured information, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
Databases are managed using Database Management Systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
They provide mechanisms for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation through structured query languages such as SQL.
Relational databases use tables with rows and columns, whereas non-relational (NoSQL) databases store data in key-value or document-based formats.
Modern applications rely heavily on databases to maintain persistent and reliable data storage.
